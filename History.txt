KalmanFilter application for RTPC12, By Jixie Zhang

1. Optimized initial values for the covariant error matrix. Wrote scripts
   to scan these initial values.  I found that 0.02 or 0.05 is the best value.
   put 0.05 as a default.  Modified the main() to allow to give the value 
   through command line argument. The usage is now looks like this:
   
  Usage: ./EXKalRTPC <job=0|1|2> <nevent> [pt_min_gev=0.1] [pt_max_gev=0.1] \
         [costh_min=-0.00001] [costh_max=0.00001] [error=0.05]
          job: 0 generate helix, 1 loadtrack from geant4 root file, 2 generate circle
          nevents: number of events to generate
          pt_min_gev and pt_max_gev: specifiy the range of pt in Gev
          Note that if pt is negative then anti-clockwise track will be generated
          costh_min and costh_max: specifiy the range of costh, only for job==0
          error is used to initialize the comvariant matrix before fitting.

2. Fixed bug in EXGenEVent::LoadATrack().  The bug is that it does not check the 
   hit ID from g4 root tree. Sometimes those hit IDs are negative numbers, which means
   they are not recontructable hits.

3. Added History.txt and macros dir.

1. Separated FitAndFilter from filling root tree. when this code is used
   by CLAS12 software, filling root tree is not necessary.

1.  Rewrote KalRTPC into a class 
2.  Added debug tools


2016/03/08  First commit into git hub. Modified from KEK KalmanFilter packages.
